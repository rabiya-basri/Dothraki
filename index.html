            <p>Convert from English to Dothraki. The Dothraki language is a constructed fictional language
                in George R. R. Martin's fantasy novel series A Song of Ice and Fire and its television 
                adaptation Game of Thrones, where it is spoken by the Dothraki, the indigenous inhabitants
                of the Dothraki Sea. The language was developed for the TV series by the linguist David J.
                Peterson based on the Dothraki words and phrases in Martin's novels.
